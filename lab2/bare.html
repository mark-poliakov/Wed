                    <p>The Gherkin is a domain-specific language designed to describe software behavior in plain text using the natural language format. It is primarily used in behavior-driven development (BDD) to write clear and concise scenarios that describe how a system should behave. These scenarios are written in the Given-When-Then format making them easy to understand for all stakeholders including the non-technical members of a team.</p>
