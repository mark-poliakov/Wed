                        <p>When small width of window makes it impossible to comfortably position all elements in a single row,
                            here comes another version of the page that perfectly solve this problem by positioning elements in
                            several rows or even in one column - another direction. The browser automatically detects the size of the 
                            window and decides which version is to be applied.
                        </p>
                        <p>Try to decrease your window size. At some point left part will move to the bottom and will appear after main content block.
                            And there will be another point (500px) when all blocks will be placed in one column.
                        </p>
