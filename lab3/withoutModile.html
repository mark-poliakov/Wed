                        <h3>Shrinking without repositioning</h3>
                        <p>The smaller window becomes the stronger all elements shrink. This lead to very little size of each block and link in the end.
                            If you use phone you will never be able to manage to hit a single button you want to.</p>
                        <p>Try to decrease your window size. Of course all blocks will preserve their proportions in width,
                            but because of that text will be hard to read and page will become weird overall.</p>

                            What is the solution?
                        </h3>
                        <p>We need to prepare another version of the page dedicated for devices with small screen size. Also this could be useful not only 
                            with device-screen-size but also with small window size even on big screens.</p>
